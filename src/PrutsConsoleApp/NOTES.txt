PropertyMapping.cs
- added getting of DefiningType e.g. for Resource.id

RoundtripTest.cs
- Added xml->turtle->xml to 

ISSUES:
- fhir-net-api related
-- ResourceReference is actually Reference
-- ComponentComponent: are there more like these?
--- composed attributes like AllergyIntolerance.reaction.subject
-- when cardinality > 1
- Are the "special" rules really nessasary?
-- e.g. around Reference. Now Turtle is the only format that has "Reference" added to the property
- Difference with Grahame's examples
-- xs:date instead of xs:dateTime for Observation.effectiveDateTime?
-- why is the Observation.component array handled differently from Observation.component.code?
- rdfdotnet related
-- datatype are surraounded by lt;gt? why? <xsd:dateTime>
-- xsd namespace instead of xs namespace?

TODO:
- Move Program.cs to Hl7.Fhir.Core.Tests and use relative and Tempfolder paths!
